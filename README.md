# firstfullstack
My first full stack project

This project is the classic version and I'll try updating it sometime later as I'm kinda new to React and the way both Front-End and Back-End connect.

The database is currently SQLite but when I tried to move the PostgreSQL the Axios started sending 401 error which shouldn't happen. I would be glad for feedback!

Before this I've made a Bank-ish Website where you transfer currency between users, but this Website is like a new start to the programming journey since it has been almost a year since I've developed a back-end website.

The Back-End uses Django and the Front-End uses React. Running the programs will differ depending on what software you are using. In order to make the website work you first have to install the files in the reqirements.txt that is located in the backend directory. You must have python and npm installed in order to run the website. There might also be requirements to make migrations and migrate the backend in order for the database to be initialized. There might be more stuff to install that I haven't talked about, for which I'm very sorry. I'm also sorry for making too many .gitignore files, I'm kind of bad at it lol.
